This is a project done by our group for the coursework at Robinson College of Business. The course title is "Big Data Infrastructure".

We used a dataset from Kaggle that stored a dataset of flight departure delays and other information. We used that dataset, preprocessed it, did the exploratory visualization, ran a few models, ran crossvalidations on those models and determined performance. 

Pretty usual stuff but what I liked most about doing this project is, compared to the previous projects/assignments we did, this was pretty large and it was taking a lot of time to go through the analysis. 

So we used Google Cloud's Dataproc services to run the computation. Never done that before. So it was a good experience.

Also, this is the first time I am uploading files in Git Hub using git push, so yay! another thing I have learned!
